Initial Coin Offering — Standards of Information Disclosure (ICO-SOID)

Full Background here : https://medium.com/@gurur/initial-coin-offering-standards-of-information-disclosure-ico-soid-dcc3ce13948b

Hundreds of ICOs with millions, if not billions, of dollars being invested with no clear standard for information disclosure or a framework for due diligence. Use this open source questionnaire as the starting point for your evaluation and hold the companies/ICOs accountable to release this information. Better yet, everyone would benefit if the companies/ICOs voluntarily provided all of this information up front in a readable format at a central location (rather than potential investors having to gather or infer this from different sites, FAQs, and Reddit discussions).
More important than the answers, if the company or entity running the ICO does not voluntarily disclose the information, that is a bigger red flag. At the same time, just because they provided the information does not mean all is golden, and the ICO is a great investment — far from it!
You may have more questions that you use as part of your evaluation, so feel free to provide them as a pull request.
